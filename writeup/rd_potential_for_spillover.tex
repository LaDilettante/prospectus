\subsection{``Price'' of spillover: sectoral variation in potential for spillover}

As implied in the theory section, when the ``price'' of spillover is high (i.e. it is difficult to obtain spillover due to the country's absorptive capacity or sector-specific characteristics), the government official would choose a bundle that has more private benefit than spillover (\Cref{fig:price_of_spillover}).

    \caption{As the ``price'' of spillover decreases, the official can get a larger amount of spillover given the same budget (i.e. the y-intercept of the budget constraint shifts up) Comparing the bundle $(s_1, b_1)$ and $(s_2, b_2)$, we see that the new bundle has more spillover and fewer bribes.}

Here I focus on industry-specific characteristics that either facilitate or hinder spillover.\footnote{Absorptive capacity, or the ability of private firms to learn from their interaction with foreign firms, is also a very important factor in determining spillover. However, given the time-varying nature of absorptive capacity, not to mention the fact that official and firms can strategically invest to improve absorptive capacity, it is much harder to have a research design studying absorptive capacity that can claim exogeneity.} Due to the divisibility of its production process, manufacturing firms tend to engage more local suppliers and generate more spillover effect than primary and tertiary sectors. In addition, within each sector there is a wide variation across industries to be exploited as well. For example, in manufacturing, food processing can have a high amount of spillover due to the sourcing of raw materials and packaging, whereas in textile and automotive industries (which require high level of technological sophistication), it is harder for foreign firms to work with local suppliers. Similarly, in tertiary sectors, finance, trading, tourisms and utilities are is generally not divisible into discrete stages to subcontract. Yet service industries such as retailing and construction have more opportunities for input suppliers \citep[138]{UNCTAD2001}.

This leads us to the following hypothesis:

\begin{quote}
Hypothesis: Government officials will pursue fewer bribes from firms in industries where it is easier to generate spillovers
\end{quote}

While such variation across industries is clear conceptually, measurement is thorny given the many factors that can affect the potential for spillover. In addition, there is an endogeneity problem as the potential for spillover may itself be affected by the level of corruption in that industry. For example, an industry plagued by collusive relationship between the official and foreign firms does not offer an enabling environment that allows private firms to develop their absorptive capacity. The endogeneity problem is compounded if the official strategically decides whether to invest and improve absorptive capacity, in which case it is not even clear in which direction is our estimate biased.

To address both of these measurement and endogeneity issues, I will use the variation in technological spillover across industries in the United States as the instrumental variable.\footnote{The United States is considered due to its high quality economic data. Alternatively, for each country, I can use a comparable country in the same region or the same developmental stage to formulate the instrument} The assumption is that the level of technological spillover in a US industry only correlates with the level of bribe in another country's industry through the latent factor that is the industry-specific potential for spillover.

To measure corruption, presence of FDI, and treatment of firms across countries, I utilize the World Bank's Enterprise Survey (ES), which includes a wealth of firm-level data across 125 countries, spanning various topics from investment, labor, to business-government relation \citep{WorldBank2015}. The Enterprise Survey uses stratified random sampling (using three strata: firm size, business sector, and region) in order to ensure representativeness. The survey data comes from face-to-face interviews with upper management and is anonymized to ensure confidentiality at all times.\footnote{For more on the methodology of the Enterprise Survey, visit \url{http://www.enterprisesurveys.org/methodology}} This dataset has a wealth of firm-level data that helps us operationalize key concepts as detailed below.

Operationalization of variables:
\begin{itemize}
\item FDI spillover: See \Cref{sec:measure_spillover}. The level of FDI by sectors is available via the Enterprises Survey dataset.\footnote{It would be better if there is UNCTAD data for FDI by sector, since the Enterprize Survey is not designed to account for all FDI inflow. Without weights, it is difficult to accurately get the population of foreign firms from the ES' sample of foreign firms.}

\item Corruption: can be measured in two ways. 1) Firms' perception about corruption as an obstacle. This measure is frequently used but is not accurate since firms' perception of corruption depends not only on the level of corruption but also the characteristics of firms. 2) Hard measure of prevalence and depth of bribes, e.g. ``Was an informal payment expected or request (when applying for a license)?'', ``How much do establishments like this one give in informal payments?'' 
\end{itemize}
