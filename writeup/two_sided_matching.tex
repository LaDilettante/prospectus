\subsection{Two-sided Matching}

\subsubsection{Hypothesis}

\subsubsection{The two-sided logit (TSL) model}

Intuition: If we have the complete data of all offers from all countries to all firms, we would have been able to figure out the preference.

In real data, we may not have this complete data, only data where firms have already chosen a country.

EM algorithm allows us to find the hidden parameters by iteratively run as follows. First, assume some values for the parameters. Then, calculate the likelihood of the label assignment. Then based on the label assignment, calculate new values for the parameters.

We don't know the preference, nor all the offers. So we assume some params values for the preference, fill in the offersn, then calculate the preference again. Rinse and repeat.
