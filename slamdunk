A lot of countries have decentralized structure like Vietnam, e.g. Brazil and Indian states

Why don't officials extract from private firms?
--> talk about cross-national makeup of constituency. Taiwan / Vietnam skeptical of domestic capital --> rely on outside capital

Mining:
- Ghana / Chile: most spillover
- Mozambique: least spillover, most corrupt

Strategic firm:
- Right now, the firm is non-strategic in the sense that there is a fixed amount of profitability that they are willing to give a way, doesn't matter whether in the form of spillover or bribe
- To make firm strategic, it means that they are being profit-maximizing, i.e. prefer that they have to share less of the profit (perhaps by working with a bribe-loving / spillover loving officials if they have cheap bribe / spillover)

Cross-national:
Time horizon:
+ autocracy: 1) institutionalization (single party vs personalist), 2) probability of violent removal of leader (check that paper by Quan Li)
+ democracy: 1) electoral competitiveness / turn over
