Pablo Pinto

- "preference towards FDI do not depend on the motivation underlying its entry into the country" -- whether the investment is resource, market, or efficiency seeking. The only requirement for the partisan motivation to be at play is that some workers benefit and some business owners are harmed directly from the inflow of FDI

--> Some counterarguments:
- seems like people care about the type of FDI as well, depending on export or market seeking, even though both should have same effect on labor according to Pablo Pinto.
- related to sociotropic voting? people care about the "country" as citizens / voting, not so much class
- the degree to which they care about class could be due to inequality? historical context?

- "It is possible that efficiency seeking FDI might be less controversial to local firms as it results in increased local procurement. Yet, the evidence suggests that more generally foreign investors import their own suppliers, that local procurement by these actors are low, and usually only results from governmental pressure to increase local content"
--> So pablo pinto does not consider the variation in spillover, and just consider all FDI to have low spillover
--> The puzzle is: if gov is pro-business, why doesn't the government push for more of local content? Why go for the route of restricting FDI totally?

Creating linkage:
- (p. 15) easiest when small technological gap; production of labor-intensive consumer goods (garment, footwear, toy) vs cutting-edge technology; indirect material, after market supplies and non-tradable service is easier to supply than key parts and components

- (p. 18) So far, automotive and electronics 
industries have been growth engines for various large and 
small firms both in developed and developing economies 
(as is the case in India, Malaysia, Mexico and South Africa). 
Agribusiness also plays a central role in economic takeâ€‘off and poverty alleviation in most locations, especially in 
least developed countries (as is the case in Uganda). Other 
industrial areas such as energy and other natural resources 
may be less open or feasible for business linkages. In the 
case of Mexico, for example, energy and natural resource 
sectors are still restricted to FDI.

- (p. 20) measure to promote linkage

India
- 1991 economic liberalization. Follow policy of self reliance, but more trade liberalization. However, the government 
But there's also industrial policy since 1991 has "aimed to integrate India into the world economy by opening the country to selective FDI and reducing regulatory control on industry." India welcomed FDI and technology collaboration. FDI was considered particularly important 
- FDI shift from primary and manufacturing to services in mid 1990, particularly financial services and ITfor the development of infrastructure energy, 
telecommunication services and software development. 

Spillover in developing country
- (p. 16) other spillovers that they don't consider (neither do I, may be good to acknowledge): infrastructure built by FDI
